# ls

The terminal is a wonderful thing!

In the past challenges, you've run different *commands* - such as `cat` and `flag`.

Commands can also have different *arguments*.

Arguments are parameters to a program. The program will behave differently based on its arguments.

Most commands support the `--help` argument.

When run with a `--help` argument, a command will display a list of the different arguments it receives.

## Try is yourself!
    run: `cat --help`


# Your goal
The `ls` command *lists* files at the current directory. It has other options as well ;)

There is a hidden file containing the flag, find it!

!!! note: hidden files
    Hidden files in linux begin with a *"."*. For example - the file *".hidden"* is a hidden file.
    

## Useful commands
* cat
* ls
* cd
