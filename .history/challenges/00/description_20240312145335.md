#Introduction

Wake up, hacker. Welcome to the Linux Basics CTF by Haad LC. Pay attention!

In this realm, Linux isn't just learned; it's conquered, CTF-style, from the very command line.

Scenario: Neo wakes up in a simulated reality and receives a mysterious message from Trinity, instructing him to find the hidden flag to unlock his true potential.

The CTF unfurls before you, a labyrinth of challenges. To emerge victorious, seek the flag: a cipher of symbols signaling your triumph.

Challenge difficulty - EASY! 

Behold, the flag for this initiation: **{{flag}}**



Embark on your journey. Execute the command:
`flag`
